# Docker port mapping
Command | Description
--- | ---
docker run -p \<host_port>:\<docker_port> | Map host_port to docker_port
docker port \<container> | Display port mapping for a running container

When  container is started/restarted the initial port mapping remains same. <br />
If a host port is already in use ( by host application or other container ), then the new container will not start ( move to stopped state ) and will display error saying port is already in use.

How to change port mapping of a running container
1) Stop and delete the container. Start fresh using run command. However all local changes will be lost.
2) Stop container. Save it as an image. Run the newly created image.
3) Stop container. Stop docker using command -> systemctl stop docker.service <br />
Navigate to <span style="color: red">/var/lib/docker/containers/\<container_id></span>. This folder will contain all the containers config files. <br />
In file <span style="color: red">hostconfig.json</span>, add appropriate port binding, "PortBindings":{"8080/tcp":[{"HostIp":"","HostPort":"8051"}]} <br />
In file <span style="color: red">config.v2.json</span>, add exposed ports, "ExposedPorts":{"8080/tcp":{}} <br />
Start docker service using command --> systemctl start docker.service <br />
Start container. Newly mapped ports will be now visible. <br />

# Docker volume
Command | Description
--- | ---
docker volume create \<volume_name> | Creates a volume at location /var/lib/docker/volumes/\<volume_name>/_data
docker volume inspect \<volume_name> | Display information about the volume
docker volume ls | Display list of volume
docker volume rm \<volume_name> | Delete volume
docker run -v \<path_or_volumename>:\<docker_path> | Map host folder to docker folder
docker run -v \<path_or_volumename>:\<docker_path>:ro | Map host folder to docker folder in read-only mode. File can be modified only from host, not from docker
docker run --volumes-from \<container> \<image> | Mount volumes as per given container.
  
1) When docker containers are restarted/started, the volume mapping remains same.
2) Multiple docker containers can be mapped to the same volume. In this case, changing file in one container will cause change in other as well.
3) --volumes-from option can be used for above point.

# Docker network
Command | Description
--- | ---
docker run --network \<network_name> \<image>:\<tag> | Start a container in a particular network
docker network create \<network_name> | Create a new network
docker network ls | List all networks
docker network rm \<network_name> | Remove a network
docker network inspect \<network_name> | Display network info
docker network prune \<network_name> | Remove networks not in use
docker network connect \<network> \<container> | Add a container to a network
docker network disconnect \<network> \<container> | Remove a container to a network

1) When we run a container, by default it gets added to the bridge (default network) network if no network is specified.<br/>
2) Only containers in a particular network can talk to each other.<br/>
3) Networks can be connected/disconnected from a network while they are running.<br/>
4) Network related information of a container can be obtained using inspect commend on a container.<br/>


# Dockerfile
Use to build Docker images from scratch or already existing image.<br/>
Link --> https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/Dockerfile.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index

1) FROM \<image_name><br/>
This is the first uncommented line of Dockerfile. The docker image will be created using the specified image as base.

2) WORKDIR \<path><br/>
Sets the current work directory.

3) MAINTAINER \<name><br/>
Set the author field.
  
4) RUN \<command><br/>
Runs specified command in the docker image during build process.

5) COPY \<src> \<dest>
Copy files from host to docker filesystem during build process. src Path should be within build context

6) ADD \<src> \<dest>
Same as COPY, but allows URL and unzips tar files.

7) ENV \<key> \<value>
Sets the env variable. The variable persists even after running the container.
